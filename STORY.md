# The Story

## Forms & Validations

As a Full Stack Developer at WhizCorp, you're now tasked with the modernization of a legacy application, named FormsApp. 
This application was our initial digital transformation of a complex, form-centric bureaucratic process. 
Subforms and select field values in this application often depended on previous selections, with validations ranging from 
basic field requirements to complex, condition-based rules.

Moreover, the application also exposes a REST API for third-party tools to submit forms, implying that validations must be consistent across the API and UI.

Your mission is to design a new solution that is not only manageable, maintainable, and extensible but also improves usability. 
We're particularly interested in enhancing state management to prevent data loss during unintended page refreshes and 
implementing a prefilling logic to pull data from external REST APIs.

Although your team lead has suggested using Angular and Spring Boot, the technology stack is open for discussion.

## Task

* Brainstorm all the problems and complexity
* Find solutions/suggestions on how to handle them
* Prepare for a discussion round with your colleagues Alice and Bob


## Questions to get started

* How would you go about this task considering the complex nature of the project and its requirements?
* Could you break down the challenges you foresee in this project? How do they relate to each other?
* How would you propose to solve these challenges, and what technologies/frameworks would you employ to do so?
