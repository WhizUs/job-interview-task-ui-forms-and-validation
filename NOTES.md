# Notes

- Try to analyze the problems from one direction, then from the other.
- In which module/layer would you place the validation and why?
- How would you best manage the application state?
- How would you best solve the problem of prefilling the form?
- How would you solve the dependant fields? How would you handle the validation of them?
- Keep open/unclear topics for the discussion with your colleagues. Teamwork is always important on difficult tasks.
